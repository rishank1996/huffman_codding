# Text Compression (Huffman Coding)
Compress a given text file using huffman coding. We should be able to read a given compressed file and decode it as well.

## Parts
1) Read and store large text files in memory
2) Compress using huffman coding
3) Store the result in a file on disk
4) Read the compressed file in memory
5) Decode the data and store in text file

## Constraints
Limited to only text files containing ASCII characters
